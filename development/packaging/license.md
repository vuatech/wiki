#Place Holder
Mention OSI approved and rare exceptions like WTFPL have opensource intent. Leave note about if a license does not show in list then ask a developer if its allowed. Also mention that opensource software like spotify-launcher is allowed but since it uses properitary services or software it must be in the restricted repos.
