# What is a license?
A software license is a legal instrument that governs the use or redistribution of software, establishing the rights and restrictions for users, developers, and providers.
## Approved license
Generally OSI approved license are allowed without any issues. License can be found at this link. https://opensource.org/licenses In some cases a license name may not be exactly the same as BSD-3-Clause and BSD-3-Clause-Open-MPI. If the text of the license matches the OSI entry then it is safe to say the license was written in a shorthand fashion. Other examples are the GLP-2.0+ that have a variety of shorthand ways to describe the same license.
## License that are open but not OSI approved
While OSI is the golden rule there are some license that are not listed but are in its intent opensource. A good example is WTFPL license below.
```
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long as the name is changed.
```
If a license falls into this category ask the developers for their opinion before packaging.
